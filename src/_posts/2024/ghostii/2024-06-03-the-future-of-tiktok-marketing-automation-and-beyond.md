## Introduction: The Evolution of TikTok Marketing

Once upon a time, social media marketing was all about Facebook likes and Twitter retweets. Then, in waltzed TikTok, flipping the script with its short, snappy videos and an algorithm that seems to have a mind of its own. The platform's meteoric rise has left marketers both excited and scratching their heads. How do you make a splash in a sea of viral dance challenges and quirky lip-syncs? 

Initially, TikTok marketing was a wild west of trial and error. Brands dipped their toes in with hashtag challenges and influencer partnerships, hoping to capture the attention of Gen Z's notoriously fleeting focus. But as the app matured, so did the strategies. Marketers began to see the potential for more targeted campaigns, leveraging the platform's unique features to create authentic, engaging content.
